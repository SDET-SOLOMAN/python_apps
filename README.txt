The goal is to create 100 small Python 'apps' / 'projects', from begginer levels all the way to Intermediate, then to Advanced and to building a PRO Python portfolio.

The idea of this 100 days code was taken from a Udemy instructor Dr. Angela Yu, here is the link for her Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

Happy Coding :)
